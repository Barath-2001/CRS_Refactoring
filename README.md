# Car Rental System ðŸš—

A simple **Car Rental System** implemented in C++, refactored to improve structure, maintainability, and readability while retaining its original functionality. The project demonstrates clean coding practices, modular design, and object-oriented programming principles.

---

## Features
- Display a list of available cars with rental prices.
- Calculate total cost based on car selection and rental duration.
- Handle user input errors gracefully.
- Scalable and easy-to-extend structure for adding more features or cars.

---

## Refactoring Highlights
1. **Code Modularity**:
   - Divided the code into smaller, reusable functions.
   - Organized the program into separate classes for Cars, Rentals, and the main system logic.

2. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - Introduced encapsulation by grouping car details and rental logic into objects.
   - Used constructors, methods, and encapsulated attributes to simplify the logic.

3. **Enhanced Readability**:
   - Improved variable and function naming for better clarity.
   - Reduced hardcoded values by storing car details dynamically.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Added input validation for car selection and rental duration.
   - Prevented crashes by checking for invalid inputs.

5. **Scalability**:
   - Made it easy to add new cars and rental features without modifying the core logic.
